Using public financial data together with in R to create an interactive Shiny App to check how noisy the stock market can be and definitely [not a tool to guide your personal finances](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/R_Stocks#important---no-investment-advice).

* Further Description at: <https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/R-Stocks/>

## Repository Structure

* The analysys Rmd file I used - [R_Stocks_Analysis.Rmd](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/R_Stocks/blob/main/R_Stocks_Analysis.Rmd)
* The final interactive dashboard - [R_Stocks_Shiny.Rmd](https://github.com/JAlcocerT/R_Stocks/blob/main/R_Stocks_Shiny.Rmd)
    * Stocks Analysis: yfR
    * Dividend Analysis: yfR, QuantMod, PriceR, *QuandDl (optional)*
    * Portfolio Analysis: yfR, QuantMod, PriceR
* **The R-Stocks App:**
    * [Docker and the R-Stocks Shiny App](https://jalcocert.github.io/JAlcocerT/building-r-shiny-apps-container-image-with-docker/)
    * Versioning of the [Docker Container Images at GHCR](https://github.com/users/JAlcocerT/packages/container/package/r-stocks)

## üéØ Features and RoadMap

* The R Shiny App:

  <summary>V1  :heavy_check_mark:</summary>
  &nbsp;

* Visualize historical trends on the specified stocks/index
* Visualize the dividend trends on different stocks, considering the different splits over the time 
* Portfolio Analysis - Check how the valuation and dividend of a given number of stocks initially
* Improve UI 

* V1.1: Selecting the stocks as environment variable in `docker-compose.yml`

* The R FlexhDashboard: <https://jalcocert.github.io/R_Stocks/>
  * Given SP500 historical data, to **classify months as per 'boom/burst'**
